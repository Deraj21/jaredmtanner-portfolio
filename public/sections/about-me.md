I am a problem solver. I really enjoy my work when I am given a problem to solve rather than a solution to code. I like sinking my teeth into a difficult challenge that makes me think outside the box, and find an innovative solution.

I like to take time to design a solution before writing a single line of code. Breaking problems down helps me weed out bad solutions quickly, and minimizes the amount of back-tracking and wasted time.

I try to get feedback as soon as I can when working on a project. In my book, every mistake is an opportunity to learn, and the sooner I can learn about a mistake, the quicker it can be course-corrected.
