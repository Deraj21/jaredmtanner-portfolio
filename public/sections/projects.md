### D&D Character Sheet Creator


Personal Project

This project comes from my love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted a quick way to generate a random character to get ideas flowing for players wanting to make characters. So I built this!

Built using React.js, it has a bare-bones single-page design. I mimicked the look of a Dungeon and Dragons character sheet when styling the site. I recently revisited this project to update the style; I learned a few CSS tricks, and got to know CSS3 really well. I also added functionality to print the character sheet, for use in-game. It is hosted using Github Pages. I hope you enjoy!

### Hangman

Personal Project

This website is a hangman game wrapped up with user rankings and fun word categories to choose from. It allows for a user to log in, play some hangman games, and then compare their scores with other players.

I love playing games, so for me, this was a really fun project to come up with and create.

I learned the importance of making an MVP plan while making this project. I designed the layout, dataflow, and database schemas all before starting to code, and it really helped me to keep track of where I was, and how far I had to go.

It was built from scratch, using create-react-app, React, Redux, Node.js, express, and a postgres database. I also used css media queries to make my project mobile-friendly.

I hosted the site with DigitalOcean for a couple months in order to learn how to host a project, and so I could share it with my friends and family.

### Trello Clone

Group Project

This project is a clone of the popular time-management tool, Trello.com. We wanted to see how far we could get into building an enterprise app between the three of us over the course of four weeks.

It was challenging, but with the help of the real Trello, we were able to decide on an MVP, divide up tasks, and set a timeline that kept us on track. Three times a week, we would hold meetings to each talk about our progress, and help each other with blockages.

We used React, Redux, and react-router to build a responsive frontend that copied the clean style of Trello. For the backend, we used Node.js, express, a postgres database, and Auth0 with sessions.
