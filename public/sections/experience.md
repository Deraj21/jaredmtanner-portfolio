## My experience falls into 2 semi-distinct areas.
1. In school I learned ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS3, expressJS, and Postgresql. This is the tech stack that I enjoy most, and the one I use for all my personal projects. And while I can create a project start to finish with this stack, I would like to gain more experience with these technologies or similar ones.
2. At my full-time job, I work inside SAP's ecosystem, meaning that I am very familiar with the frontend Javascript framework sapui5. I am also well-versed in creating oData APIs with ABAP CDS, RAP, and the BOPF framework.
