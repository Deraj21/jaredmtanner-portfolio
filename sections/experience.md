## Experience
**My experience falls into 2 areas.**
1. In school I learned ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS3, expressJS, and Postgresql. This is the tech stack that I enjoy most, and the one I use for all my personal projects. I can create a project start to finish with this stack. I am also quick to learn a new technology as I find a need for it.
2. At my full-time job, I work inside SAP's ecosystem, meaning that I am very familiar with the frontend Javascript framework sapui5. I am also well-versed in creating oData APIs with ABAP CDS, RAP, and the BOPF framework.
