**I am a problem solver.**
I really enjoy my work when I am given a problem to solve rather than a website to code. I like sinking my teeth into a difficult challenge that makes me think outside the box, and find an innovative solution.

**I design solutions before writing a single line of code.**
Breaking problems down helps me weed out bad solutions quickly, and minimizes the amount of back-tracking and wasted time.

**I try my best to get feedback early and often.** In my book, mistakes are opportunities to learn, and following the direction of real users will guide the solution to be better than I could ever make it on my own.
