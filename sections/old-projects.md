Personal Project

This website is a hangman game wrapped up with user rankings and fun word categories to choose from. It allows for a user to log in, play some hangman games, and then compare their scores with other players.

I love playing games, so for me, this was a really fun project to come up with and create.

I learned the importance of making an MVP plan while making this project. I designed the layout, dataflow, and database schemas all before starting to code, and it really helped me to keep track of where I was, and how far I had to go.

It was built from scratch, using create-react-app, React, Redux, Node.js, express, and a postgres database. I also used css media queries to make my project mobile-friendly.

I hosted the site with DigitalOcean for a couple months in order to learn how to host a project, and so I could share it with my friends and family.
