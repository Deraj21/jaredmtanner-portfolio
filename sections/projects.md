This project comes from my love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted a quick way to generate a random character to get ideas flowing for players wanting to make characters. So I built this!

Built using React.js, it has a bare-bones single-page design. I mimicked the look of a Dungeon and Dragons character sheet when styling the site. I recently revisited this project to update the style; I learned a few CSS tricks, and got to know CSS3 really well. I also added functionality to print the character sheet, for use in-game. It is hosted using Github Pages. I hope you enjoy!

My wife and I enjoy the board game *“Cryptid”*, but you need at least 3 people to play it. Instead of going out and finding friends to play with, I built a bot that acts as the additional players.

This project features drag-and-drop board pieces to set up the game, components from the Material UI library, and complex bot logic to tell the player the needed information to play the game.




## Trello Clone

This is a group project I did while attending DevMountain. It's a clone of the popular time-management tool, Trello.com. We wanted to see how far we could get into building an enterprise app between the three of us over the course of four weeks.

It was challenging, but with the help of the real Trello, we were able to decide on an MVP, divide up tasks, and set a timeline that kept us on track. Three times a week, we would hold meetings to each talk about our progress, and help each other with blockages.

We used React, Redux, and react-router to build a responsive frontend that copied the clean style of Trello. For the backend, we used Node.js, express, a postgres database, and Auth0 with sessions.
