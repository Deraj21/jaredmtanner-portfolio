## Description:
This is a simple protfolio site that I made with React, and hosted with github pages.
The master branch contains the source code.
The 'gh-pages' contains the built version of the app.

I used:
- react-react-app
- this tutorial: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master
- markdown to html conversion tool https://github.com/sibiraj-s/marked-react
- this portfolio template, which I turned into a react app: https://github.com/bmorelli25/portfolio-template
